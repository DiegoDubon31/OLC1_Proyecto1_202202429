# User Manual - Prisoner's Dilemma

The **Prisoner's Dilemma** is a paradox in **decision theory**, where two individuals acting in their own **self-interest** fail to achieve the optimal outcome. It presents a scenario in which two suspects have been **arrested** for a crime. They are **separated** and **unable to communicate**, and each must independently choose between **cooperating** with the other or **defecting**.

The highest collective reward occurs when both choose to cooperate. However, rational self-interest often leads them to defect, resulting in a worse outcome for both.

They receive the following offers:

1. If one cooperates and the other defects, the cooperator receives no punishment (is released), while the defector receives the maximum sentence.
2. If both cooperate, they both receive a moderate sentence.
3. If both defect, they both receive a minor sentence (but worse than if they had cooperated).

The software presented simulates this dilemma, by defining strategies, matches, and running this matches.
